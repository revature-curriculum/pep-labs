     *
     * Let's try writing a for loop at the 'code here' point...
     *      for loops have several parts, which follow the syntax
     *          for(1; 2; 3;){
     *              //code running inside loop
     *          }
     *      1. we declare some variable (by convention, called i, j, or k)
     *      2. we define a condition that must be met for the code within the block to run (usually to do with the variable)
     *      3. we define some operation that happens at the end of that block (usually incrementing/decrementing i).
     *
     *      in practice, that would look like
     *          for(int i = 0; i < 8; i++){
     *              System.out.print(i);
     *          }
     *          which prints out:
     *          01234567
     *          notice that i is a variable that can be accessed from inside the loop, that i=0 is inclusive,
     *          but the i<8 is exclusive, and that i++ allows i to be incremented *after* all the code inside the loop
     *          runs.
     *
     *      let's try it, at the "code here" point, write:
     *      for part 1, write
     *          int i = start;
     *      for part 2, write
     *          i < end;
     *      for part 3, write
     *          i++;
     *      within the for loop block, let's have the following code:
     *          buildingString = buildingString + i + " ";
     *      this will add the current value of i to an already existing variable 'sum', so that we can get the sum of
     *      all numbers that fall between start and end.
     *      you can consult any for loop example to resolve syntax issues.
     *
     *      @param start the value of i where the for loop should start.
     *      @param end the value of i where the for loop should end (provided that the for loop is incremented with i++)
     *      @return the sum of all numbers between start and end, with start inclusive and end exclusive.
     */
    public String returnNumbers(int start, int end){
        String buildingString = "";

//        code here
            for(int i = 0; i < 6; i++){             
               
            }
        return buildingString + "";
    }
