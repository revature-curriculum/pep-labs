    /**
     * The Math class contains utility methods that can be used for calculations like exponents, rounding, random
     * number generation, etc. The point of this challenge, however, is not strictly to use the Math class - there are
     * many "Utility Classes" while follow a curious pattern - where we usually instantiate an object before using it,
     * classes such as Math, Arrays, System are used without instantiating the object - we would skip directly to using
     * a method such as Math.pow() immediately. How does this work?
     *
     * The Math class contains static methods, which means that it does not need to be instantiated for a developer
     * to use the contained methods. They are global to the entire program. This is very important to understand,
     * as new coders often misuse the static keyword. So, static methods and variables of Math are associated with the
     * Math class rather than a Math object.
     *
     * This is also an exercise in reading the official Oracle documentation rather than relying on a tutorial for
     * beginners. In the future, when you will be navigating complex topics, you will need to rely on official
     * documentation to learn how to use new tools, which is oftentimes rather dry.
     * Enjoy: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html
