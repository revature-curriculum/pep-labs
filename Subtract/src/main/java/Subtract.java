     * Let's say we're building a calculator app. We now want to subtract a decimal number from another decimal number.
     *
     * This challenge follows a similar process to 'add', but you may notice that this problem uses doubles
     * rather than ints.
     *
     * Doubles represent numbers that may contain decimals. Whether you use an int or double in your projects
     * depends on the use case. (For instance, you count the number of puppies at your pet store with int / whole
     * numbers, but prices are better represented with doubles / decimal numbers.)
     *
     * @param a some decimal number
     * @param b some decimal number
     * @return a minus b
